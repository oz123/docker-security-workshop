IT Security summit - Securing docker containers
===============================================

In the directory `hands-on` you will a `Vagrantfile`
with instructions to build a virtual machine on which you
can run all exercises.

The file `Contents.md` describes the contents of the workshop.

The `slides.pdf` do not contain much, because the workshop
is mostly about running the exercises yourself, instead of
letting the mentor do all the talking.

 *learning by doing!* is the motto of this workshop.

Requirements:

 1. basic linux skills.
 2. A computer with VirtualBox and Vagrant installed.
